# Ti-pooling_pytorch
The Pytorch version of Ti-pooling

This repository contains PyTorch implementations of TI-pooling (transformation-invariant pooling) from the following paper:

"TI-pooling: transformation-invariant pooling for feature learning in Convolutional Neural Networks" D. Laptev, N. Savinov, J.M. Buhmann, M. Pollefeys, CVPR 2016." 

The original paper provides experimental evaluation on three datasets. This repository contains only the model of Ti-pooling.
